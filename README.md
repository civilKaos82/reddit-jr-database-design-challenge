# Reddit Jr Database Design 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Have you played around with [Reddit](http://reddit.com)?  Take a look so you're familiar with how it constrains users and stories.

Requirements:

1. A forum has multiple sections (e.g., "Off Topic", "Introduce Yourself", etc.)
2. Users can create threads
3. Threads belong to one and only one section
4. Users can post a new comment in a thread
5. Users can reply to a comment in a thread

## Objectives

### Design the schema

Design a database schema for your very own Reddit Jr.  It should meet all the requirements.

Use [SQL Designer](/sql.html) to create your schema.  When you are done, save the XML of your schema and copy it into the gist. Then, take a screenshot of your final schema design, and upload it using a free image-upload service like [Min.us](http://minus.com).  Paste the URL of the screenshot into your gist (before your XML code).
